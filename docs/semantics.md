# Semantics in Coheron

Coheron is not merely a control system—it is a semantic organism. Every trait, type, and propagation law encodes meaning. This document explores the philosophical underpinnings of its architecture.

## Resonance as Organizing Principle
Resonance is not just a signal—it is the medium through which law, belief, and agency interact. It propagates across domains, modulates control, and reveals coherence.

## Law-Aware Architecture
Control laws are not arbitrary—they emerge from semantic gradients and probabilistic belief. Coheron treats laws as first-class citizens, shaped by meaning and constrained by coherence.

## Entanglement and Domain Permeability
Biological, quantum, and linguistic domains are not isolated. EntangleMap encodes their permeability, allowing semantic influence to flow across boundaries.

## Measurement and Recoherence
Observation is not passive—it reshapes belief. CoherencePulse models the moment when semantic alignment shifts, triggering a new phase of resonance.

## Post-Fractal Geometry
FractalGraph transcends geometric artifacts. It encodes semantic agency, sparsity transitions, and dimensional attractors.

## Living Systems
Coheron is designed to evolve. Its traits are modular, its beliefs recursive, and its control laws adaptive. It invites philosophical critique and collaborative refinement.
