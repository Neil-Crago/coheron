# Glossary

### Resonance
A measure of semantic alignment and influence propagation. Analogous to amplitude in physics, but encoded with meaning.

### Coherence
The degree to which semantic structures align lawfully. High coherence implies low entropy and stable control laws.

### Entanglement
Cross-domain semantic coupling. Can be biological, quantum, linguistic, or conceptual.

### BeliefTensor
A trait representing probabilistic belief over latent semantic states. Supports update, entropy, and observation.

### ControlLaw
A synthesized directive derived from belief and resonance. Encodes semantic torque and alignment.

### SemanticEngine
The orchestrator of Coheron. Evolves belief, computes resonance, synthesizes control, and propagates meaning.

### CoherencePulse
A semantic heartbeat. Triggers when alignment shifts or entropy exceeds thresholds.

### FusionStrategy
A modular interface for combining multiple belief models into a unified posterior.

### FractalGraph
A post-Euclidean structure for propagating semantic influence. May encode sparsity, attractors, and dimensional transitions.
