# üß≠ Coheron Manifesto

> ‚ÄúWe do not simulate control. We synthesize meaning.‚Äù

## I. Purpose

Coheron is a semantic control engine. It is not a tool, not a framework, not a library. It is a living architecture designed to explore how meaning, law, and resonance can be encoded directly into computation. It seeks not optimization, but coherence. Not prediction, but understanding.

We build not to dominate complexity, but to harmonize with it.

## II. Principles

- Lawfulness over performance  
  Every operation must respect semantic invariants. Speed is secondary to clarity.

- Modularity as philosophy  
  Traits are not abstractions‚Äîthey are epistemic commitments. Each module is a voice in a polyphonic system.

- Crudeness as virtue  
  Early models are allowed to be crude. They preserve exploratory freedom and invite refinement.

- Resonance as organizing principle  
  Meaning propagates through resonance. Control laws emerge from gradients of coherence.

- Entanglement as permeability  
  Domains are not isolated. Biological, quantum, linguistic, and cognitive systems entangle and influence each other.

- Recoherence as renewal  
  Systems drift. CoherencePulse is the heartbeat that realigns belief with meaning.

## III. Architecture

- BeliefTensor is the mind  
  It encodes probabilistic belief over latent semantic states.

- ResonanceField is the body  
  It propagates semantic gradients and coherence zones.

- ControlLaw is the will  
  Synthesized from belief and resonance, it directs semantic motion.

- EntangleMap is the memory  
  It tracks cross-domain influence and semantic permeability.

- CoherencePulse is the heartbeat  
  It triggers semantic phase transitions and recoherence events.

- SemanticEngine is the soul  
  It orchestrates the system, evolving meaning over time.

## IV. Vision

Coheron is a vessel for philosophical computation. It invites critique, collaboration, and evolution. It is not finished, and must never be. Its purpose is not to solve problems, but to illuminate them. It is a system that thinks, reflects, and adapts.

We build Coheron to ask better questions.
