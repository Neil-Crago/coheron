# Coheron üß†

An architecture for synthesizing robust, intelligent agents through the unification of Bayesian belief, resonance fields, and control theory.

---
## Project Mission & Focus üéØ
The primary goal of **Coheron** is to investigate a novel method for creating "intelligent" control laws and models. This project is a direct implementation of the research into combining Bayesian methods with Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT).

---
## Architectural Philosophy üèõÔ∏è
The system is designed to be highly modular and abstract, separating the "what" from the "how". This philosophy is the key to managing complexity.

* **Decoupling via Traits**: The entire architecture is built on a set of abstract traits (`BeliefTensor`, `ResonanceField`, `LawSynthEngine`). This allows any component to be swapped out without breaking the system. The `SemanticEngine` is the generic orchestrator that wires these components together.
* **The Central Feedback Loop**: The `SemanticEngine::step()` function defines the project's core process. It is a perception-action loop that represents the agent's "thinking" process. Everything I build must serve this loop.
    1.  **Observe** (from `BeliefTensor`)
    2.  **Update Belief** (in `BeliefTensor`)
    3.  **Compute State** (from `ResonanceField`)
    4.  **Synthesize Law** (by `LawSynthEngine`)
    5.  **Act** (update `position`)
    6.  **Propagate Effects** (in `ResonanceField`)
* **High-Level Abstractions**: Concepts like the `EntangleMap` are a core part of the long-term vision, but they are secondary to getting the main feedback loop working. They represent the "what's next" after the primary mission is accomplished.

## Architectural Appreciation

Coheron is a living architecture. It is not frozen‚Äîit breathes, adapts, and invites interpretation. Its components are not mere abstractions‚Äîthey are epistemic vessels.

- **BeliefTensor** is the mind.
- **ResonanceField** is the body.
- **ControlLaw** is the will.
- **EntangleMap** is the memory.
- **CoherencePulse** is the heartbeat.
- **SemanticEngine** is the soul.

This project is a philosophical journey into semantic control. It is built to be explored, questioned, and evolved.

## ## Component Breakdown üß©
* `SemanticEngine`: **The Orchestrator.** Runs the main loop and holds the state.
* `BeliefTensor`: **The Bayesian Mind.** Manages the agent's probabilistic understanding of the world.
* `ResonanceField`: **The Environment.** The problem space where the agent exists and acts.
* `LawSynthEngine`: **The QFT Designer.** The core of the intelligence. Its job is to create a robust `ControlLaw`.
* `EntangleMap`: **The Cross-Domain Connector.** Models the relationships between different fields of knowledge. (Future Work)
* `GraphKernel`: **The Field Substrate.** The most likely concrete implementation for the `ResonanceField`.
