# Coheron üß†

An architecture for synthesizing robust, intelligent agents through the unification of Bayesian belief, resonance fields, and control theory.

---
## ## Project Mission & Focus üéØ
The primary goal of **Coheron** is to investigate a novel method for creating "intelligent" control laws and models. This project is a direct implementation of the research into combining Bayesian methods with Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT).

**My focus is to stay on "Route 1":**

> **Develop a `LawSynthEngine` that can synthesize a robust `ControlLaw` (e.g., a polynomial controller) by observing a probabilistic `BeliefTensor` and the state of a `ResonanceField`.**

Side projects and explorations must be parked until a working prototype of this core feedback loop is complete. The central question I am answering is: *Can a system learn to generate guaranteed-performance control laws in the face of uncertainty?*

## ## Architectural Philosophy üèõÔ∏è
The system is designed to be highly modular and abstract, separating the "what" from the "how". This philosophy is the key to managing complexity.

* **Decoupling via Traits**: The entire architecture is built on a set of abstract traits (`BeliefTensor`, `ResonanceField`, `LawSynthEngine`). This allows any component to be swapped out without breaking the system. The `SemanticEngine` is the generic orchestrator that wires these components together.
* **The Central Feedback Loop**: The `SemanticEngine::step()` function defines the project's core process. It is a perception-action loop that represents the agent's "thinking" process. Everything I build must serve this loop.
    1.  **Observe** (from `BeliefTensor`)
    2.  **Update Belief** (in `BeliefTensor`)
    3.  **Compute State** (from `ResonanceField`)
    4.  **Synthesize Law** (by `LawSynthEngine`)
    5.  **Act** (update `position`)
    6.  **Propagate Effects** (in `ResonanceField`)
* **High-Level Abstractions**: Concepts like the `EntangleMap` are a core part of the long-term vision, but they are secondary to getting the main feedback loop working. They represent the "what's next" after the primary mission is accomplished.

## ## Component Breakdown üß©
* `SemanticEngine`: **The Orchestrator.** Runs the main loop and holds the state.
* `BeliefTensor`: **The Bayesian Mind.** Manages the agent's probabilistic understanding of the world.
* `ResonanceField`: **The Environment.** The problem space where the agent exists and acts.
* `LawSynthEngine`: **The QFT Designer.** The core of the intelligence. Its job is to create a robust `ControlLaw`.
* `EntangleMap`: **The Cross-Domain Connector.** Models the relationships between different fields of knowledge. (Future Work)
* `GraphKernel`: **The Field Substrate.** The most likely concrete implementation for the `ResonanceField`.

## ## The Roadmap: My Path Forward üó∫Ô∏è
This is the plan. I will not deviate until Phase 1 is complete.

### ### Phase 1: Implement the Core Loop (Route 1)
My immediate and only priority is to create the first concrete, end-to-end implementation.

1.  **[ ] Flesh out `BeliefTensor`**: Implement a simple Gaussian or Kalman filter-based belief system. It needs to produce a `Posterior` that represents uncertainty.
2.  **[ ] Implement `ResonanceField`**: Use the `GraphKernel` as the foundation. Define the logic for how `Resonance` is stored in the nodes and how it propagates through the edges.
3.  **[ ] Define `ControlLaw` & `apply_control`**: Decide on the structure of the `ControlLaw` (e.g., a struct containing polynomial coefficients). Implement the `apply_control` logic in `SemanticEngine` to update the `position`.
4.  **[ ] Design the `LawSynthEngine`**: This is the **main task**. I need to create the first version of the core algorithm that takes a belief distribution and a resonance state and synthesizes a stable `ControlLaw`.

### ### Phase 2: Explore the Constrained Model (Route 2)
*(Locked until Phase 1 is functional)*

This involves using the QFT-style constraints as informative priors within the Bayesian `BeliefTensor` itself.

### ### Phase 3: Investigate the `EntangleMap`
*(Locked until Phase 2 is underway)*

This involves exploring how a `ControlLaw` synthesized for one `SemanticDomain` can be influenced by couplings to other domains.
